#Spiral Knights Model to OBJ Info

I do not update the code in the repository all too often. Instead, I package source code in a .ZIP with each release.

**This means that you should *not* take source code from GitHub's preset "source.zip" in the releases**


**If you plan to release one of these models on the Garry's Mod workshop, I ask that you mention my tool there!**

Current work status: **Working on project!**

##What is Spiral Knights Model to OBJ?
Spiral Knights model to OBJ is a tool for anyone who wants to animate or 3D print models from Spiral Knights!

The tool is very straightforward and easy to use. It opens 3D Models from Spiral Knights and converts them to a format that tools such as Blender or Autodesk 3DS Max can open for usage in animation / 3D printing.


###What can it convert?
 - DAT Directly from the Spiral Knights game files

####What else do you plan on? (Plans for the future)
 - Multi-texture support (Models that have 2 different textures used on the same model at the same time)
 - Bone-data support for animations
 - Referenced models (If a model says "Attach this other model to me!", the code will be able to detect that and will also load the other model)

#####Special Thanks
 - Grey Havens: You guys are awesome! Thank you **so much** for making your source code open source. I couldn't have done this without you guys.
 - The Spiral Knights community. Some of you guys have been following my topics and giving feedback (More, "I can't wait for this program!") and letting me know that this project matters.
 - People whose libraries I used.
 - Impulse™ ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/ImpulseTru ) for staying with me through out the whole project and being an excellent bug-sniffer.
 - System76 ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/system76 - Private Profile) for being someone else doing what I was doing. He's got some parts that I don't have, and I have some parts that he doesn't have. He's helping with the format.
